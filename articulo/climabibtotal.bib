	abstract = "Fluctuations in spring climate in the western United States over the last 4--5 decades are described by examining changes in the blooming of plants and the timing of snowmelt--runoff pulses. The two measures of spring{\rq}s onset that are employed are the timing of first bloom of lilac and honeysuckle bushes from a long-term cooperative phenological network, and the timing of the first major pulse of snowmelt recorded from high-elevation streams. Both measures contain year-to-year fluctuations, with typical year-to-year fluctuations at a given site of one to three weeks. These fluctuations are spatially coherent, forming regional patterns that cover most of the west. Fluctuations in lilac first bloom dates are highly correlated to those of honeysuckle, and both are significantly correlated with those of the spring snowmelt pulse. Each of these measures, then, probably respond to a common mechanism. Various analyses indicate that anomalous temperature exerts the greatest influence upon both interannual and secular changes in the onset of spring in these networks. Earlier spring onsets since the late 1970s are a remarkable feature of the records, and reflect the unusual spell of warmer-than-normal springs in western North America during this period. The warm episodes are clearly related to larger-scale atmospheric conditions across North America and the North Pacific, but whether this is predominantly an expression of natural variability or also a symptom of global warming is not certain.",

	abstract = "Using phenological and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data from 1982 to 1993 at seven sample stations in temperate eastern China, we calculated the cumulative frequency of leaf unfolding and leaf coloration dates for deciduous species every 5 days throughout the study period. Then, we determined the growing season beginning and end dates by computing times when 50\% of the species had undergone leaf unfolding and leaf coloration for each station year. Next, we used these beginning and end dates of the growing season as time markers to determine corresponding threshold NDVI values on NDVI curves for the pixels overlaying phenological stations. Based on a cluster analysis, we determined extrapolation areas for each phenological station in every year, and then implemented the spatial extrapolation of growing season parameters from the seven sample stations to all possible meteorological stations in the study area. Results show that spatial patterns of growing season beginning and end dates correlate significantly with spatial patterns of mean air temperatures in spring and autumn, respectively. Contrasting with results from similar studies in Europe and North America, our study suggests that there is a significant delay in leaf coloration dates, along with a less pronounced advance of leaf unfolding dates in different latitudinal zones and the whole area from 1982 to 1993. The growing season has been extended by 1.4--3.6 days per year in the northern zones and by 1.4 days per year across the entire study area on average. The apparent delay in growing season end dates is associated with regional cooling from late spring to summer, while the insignificant advancement in beginning dates corresponds to inconsistent temperature trend changes from late winter to spring. On an interannual basis, growing season beginning and end dates correlate negatively with mean air temperatures from February to April and from May to June, respectively.",

	abstract = "Increasing surface temperatures are expected to result in longer growing seasons. An optimal detection analysis is carried out to assess the significance of increases in the growing season length during 1950--99, and to measure the anthropogenic component of the change. The signal is found to be detectable, both on global and continental scales, and human influence needs to be accounted for if it is to be fully explained. The change in the growing season length is found to be asymmetric and largely due to the earlier onset of spring, rather than the later ending of autumn. The growing season length, based on exceedence of local temperature thresholds, has a rate of increase of about 1.5 days decade1 over the observation area. Local variations also allow for negative trends in parts of North America. The analysis suggests that the signal can be attributed to the anthropogenic forcings that have acted on the climate system and no other forcings are necessary to describe the change. Model projections predict that under future climate change the later ending of autumn will also contribute significantly to the lengthening of the growing season, which will increase in the twenty-first century by more than a month. Such major changes in seasonality will affect physical and biological systems in several ways, leading to important environmental and socioeconomic consequences and adaptation challenges.",

	abstract = "A statistical probabilistic forecast scheme for predicting wet season onset in north Australia was developed by Lo et al. (2007) using the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) in austral winter as the sole predictor. This current study investigates the use of different predictors with the goal of improving forecast skill, and extends the scheme to also forecast wet season duration. An empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of austral winter sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the Indo-Pacific is used to characterize the major modes of interannual climate variability affecting rainfall in the austral spring and summer. The first three EOFs have statistically significant correlations with both onset and duration, indicating the EOFs are potentially good predictors. Brier skill scores for cross-validated hindcasts show that these predictors are more skilful than the SOI or other defined SST predictors. The predictors are applied here to provide forecasts for both onset and duration.",

	abstract = "Abstract Aiming to improve the knowledge of droughts in Europe, three indices related to dry spells, DS, regime have been analysed: the number of \{DS\} per year, N; the longest annual DS, Lmax; and the mean \{DS\} length per year, L, for different daily rainfall thresholds (0.1, 1.0, 5.0 and 10.0 mm/day) at annual and seasonal scales. The database consists of daily records from 267 rain gauges, along the years 1951-2000. First, the mean values at annual and seasonal scales of these three indices are represented for the four thresholds. For 0.1 and 1.0 mm/day, spatial patterns suggest a strong N-S gradient for latitudes south of 45ºN, especially at annual scale and in summer season. For 5.0 and 10.0 mm/day, the patterns are different, with a strong gradient in the Scandinavian Peninsula and the largest Lmax and L at \{NE\} Europe, except for summer. Second, a Principal Component Analysis, PCA, is applied to the 60 variables (three indices at five time scales and four thresholds) characterizing the \{DS\} regime of every gauge. A clustering process leads to a classification of the 267 rain gauges into 20 spatial clusters, on the basis of five selected principal components replacing the original variables. Most of clusters are spatially coherent, with greater spatial variability on \{DS\} regimes towards the south and west than to the north and east of Europe. And third, time trends on the three indices are quantified by the Kendall-tau algorithm, and statistical significances at 95\% confidence level are assessed by the Mann-Kendall test. For all thresholds and seasons, there is a clear predominance of significant negative trends for N. Specifically, the highest number of rain gauges with significant negative trends correspond to summer and winter, with average percentages from −\&\#xa0;2.7 to −\&\#xa0;8.1\% per decade. In summer, significant negative trends are observed in Western Europe at 40º - 60ºN and between 10ºW and 20ºE. In annual and winter periods, negative trends are detected also at Western Europe for 0.1 and 1.0 mm/day and at latitudes south of 45ºN for the two highest thresholds. Spring, and especially autumn, are characterised by a low number of negative trends, particularly for 1.0, 5.0 and 10.0 mm/day. In summer, Lmax depicts remarkable positive trends in Western Europe, at 40ºN -- 60ºN and between 0º E and 20º E, with high average values close to +\&\#xa0;10\% per decade. Positive trends on L are dominant at annual scale and winter for 0.1 mm/day, and in summer for 0.1 and 1.0 mm/day, with average trends ranging from +\&\#xa0;4.8 to +\&\#xa0;8.1\% per decade. Spring and autumn are characterised by numerous negative trends on L for all thresholds.",

	abstract = "The pluviometric regime of Catalonia (NE Spain) is analyzed from the point of view of empirical dry period lengths by considering 78 rain stations for an average of 34 years. Two possible statistical models are tested. The first model is the exponential distribution that offers reasonable results for moderate or long sequences of dry days. The other possibility comes from Markov chains of first or second order, with two or four states quantifying precipitation amounts, that are used to give better results for all the range of sequences. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test has been applied with the aim of verifying the fit between empirical probabilities of the sequences and theoretical probabilities given by the exponential distribution and the Markov chains. It is noticeable that the Markov chain of second order is many times the distribution either satisfying the test criteria or the closest one to its fulfilment. The exponential distribution satisfies better the test criteria only for a few gauges and we have to keep in mind that for a remarkable number of pluviometric stations, none of the proposed models accomplish the test. In spite of these limited results, the Markov chains are employed to quantify important aspects which can not be studied by the exponential distribution. These aspects include return periods for a new dry or wet episode and the stationary probabilities for different precipitation amounts quantifying the states of the chains, among other aspects. As a global achievement and remembering the limited success of the test, the results depicted by Markov chains of first and second order are employed to show a differentiated behaviour among the Pyrenees and Pre-Pyrenees areas, the Central Basin, the Littoral and Pre-Littoral areas, the Transversal chain and the southern Mediterranean coast. © 1998 Royal Meteorological Society",

The region is characterized by a marked water deficit in the summer, a pronounced irregularity in its rainfall regime, and a noteworthy frequency of dry spells or periods without appreciable rainfall. The results obtained confirm the general previsions of the IPCC, with a predominance of dry years over wet ones and a negative rainfall trend in the central sector. An increase in intra-annual variability in rainfall, and a very pronounced occurrence of dry periods independent of the total annual rainfall, are also seen. These circumstances will potentially increase the vulnerability of several Mediterranean ecosystems located along the gradient that are currently subject to considerable pressure from human activities; this will increase the environmental problems of these zones (agro-forestry--grazing productivity, soil degradation, recharge of aquifers, forest fires, runoff models, biological diversity and composition, etc.).",

Markov chain models are used to explore the temporal rainfall patterns in the area and to characterize the persistence of daily rain in terms of the order of the discrete Markov process. The Markov models---theoretical probabilities---are fitted to the empirical probability of wet spells lasting one more day than a specific length in the time series under the assumption of three different values (1, 5 and 10 mm) of a minimum threshold. Markovian orders that first fit the empirical distributions are used to map the theoretical persistence of daily rainfall in the Basque Country area through the use of geostatistical interpolators. Markovian orders have been confirmed as remarkable stochastic models for fitting empirical distributions of wet spells in this area, ultimately being shown as a spatial representation of theoretical persistence.

Applying Ward's cluster-analysis method identifies eight regions with distinctive AMDSL behaviours for Iran. Homogeneity testing indicates that most of these regions are homogenous. The goodness-of-fit test ZDist shows that Generalized Logistic; Generalized Extreme Value and Pearson type III, distributions fit best for most regions. The spatial pattern of L-Moment statistics demonstrates that although the northwestern and northern parts of the country experience short dry spells, these periods are inconstant, and extreme dry spell events may happen in these areas. Almost all spatial mapping of AMDSLs at different probabilistic levels demonstrates that dry spells increase gradually from west to east and from north to south, and the southern parts (especially along the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea) and central areas, including most agricultural lands, stand out as the most sensitive to soil moisture deficits, because of longer lasting droughts.

In a like fashion, the longest spells, of length equal to or greater than 7, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 days, and the number of days comprising them, for a threshold of 0.1 mm, have been taken into account and mapped. In a great part of Spain, the mean and maximum lengths of the dry spells are very high. Secondly, Markov chains of different orders, up to the tenth-order, have been used to fit the duration of dry spells of different lengths, with a 0.1 mm threshold. The adjustment of the general distribution of the dry spells according to their length and the adjustment of the longest spells, those that exceed 1, 2 or 3 months duration, have been considered. The goodness (or not) of the adjustments permits regionalization of the country, showing up three types of behaviour: one, a Markovian in which the adjustments are acceptable, in the north of Spain; a second, with good general adjustment, but with notable discrepancies between the empirical values and those estimated for the longest spells, in a central area; and a third, in which both adjustments have to be rejected, and so drought can not be considered a Markovian phenomenon, in the south.

We analyzed these data using Two State First-order Markov Chain Model and we also have determined the relating short term features of wet and dry periods like simple and ecological probabilities, Duration of wet and dry periods, mathematical expectations, and meteorological cycles. Analyzing the daily precipitation clarified the condition of spring and summer seasons from the viewpoint of wet and dry periods. The results expressed that the number of dry days were more than the number of wet days in summer. Also the probability of the occurrence of two successive dry days is more than the other probabilities both in spring and summer. The results also showed that no conspicuous difference between simple and ecological probabilities in our station of study is noted. The maximum of mathematical expectation and meteorological cycle of dry periods in summers was more than that for spring and wet periods which shows that the dry periods expected for summer is more than that for spring and wet periods. The results of this research can be used for local planning and proper local anticipations.",

	abstract = "The occurrence of wet and dry spells is a phenomenon most often used to identify the arid and semi-arid lands (ASAL) in Kenya. The use of first-order Markov processes that are embedded into a computer model to determine the critical climate extremes is presented. The model uses the concepts of conditional probability, Poisson probability distribution function and chi-square testing to predict the critical spells. The daily rainfall data (1981--2000) for two weather stations in the Kano Plains (Kenya) have been used to illustrate model application. For example, based upon the bimodal rainfall pattern in the study area, the model revealed the length of the critical dry spell to be 14 days in the long rainy season and 12 days in the short rainy season, while the critical wet spell was found to be 12 and 8 days, for the long and short rains respectively for Ahero Irrigation Scheme. It is recommended that a climate and environmental audit in the Kano Plains for the determination of land and water management strategies include critical dry and wet spell determination. This will enhance more sustainable planning and utilization of the crucial water and land resources in the region and in other tropical rangelands. There are possibilities of integrating the model with other agro-ecosystems models and other natural resource management decision support systems. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.",

	abstract = "The development of the rainfall occurrence model is greatly important not only for data-generation purposes, but also in providing informative resources for future advancements in water-related sectors, such as water resource management and the hydrological and agricultural sectors. Various kinds of probability models had been introduced to a sequence of dry (wet) days by previous researchers in the field. Based on the probability models developed previously, the present study is aimed to propose three types of mixture distributions, namely, the mixture of two log series distributions (LSD), the mixture of the log series Poisson distribution (MLPD), and the mixture of the log series and geometric distributions (MLGD), as the alternative probability models to describe the distribution of dry (wet) spells in daily rainfall events. In order to test the performance of the proposed new models with the other nine existing probability models, 54 data sets which had been published by several authors were reanalyzed in this study. Also, the new data sets of daily observations from the six selected rainfall stations in Peninsular Malaysia for the period 1975--2004 were used. In determining the best fitting distribution to describe the observed distribution of dry (wet) spells, a Chi-square goodness-of-fit test was considered. The results revealed that the new method proposed that MLGD and MLPD showed a better fit as more than half of the data sets successfully fitted the distribution of dry and wet spells. However, the existing models, such as the truncated negative binomial and the modified LSD, were also among the successful probability models to represent the sequence of dry (wet) days in daily rainfall occurrence.",

In this study, the Canadian \{RCM\} (CRCM) projected changes to dry spell characteristics over Canada, for the April--September period, and their validation in current climate, are presented. Two \{CRCM\} integrations are considered; one validation integration for the 1961--2000 period and a transient climate change integration for the 1961--2100 period, corresponding to the \{SRES\} \{A2\} scenario. The ability of the model to simulate dry spell characteristics, i.e. mean number of dry days, mean number of dry spells and selected return levels of maximum dry spell durations, and associated errors are assessed through comparison of integrations for the current 1971--2000 April--September period with those observed, derived from the observed precipitation records. Results suggest an underestimation of the mean number of dry days and 10- and 30-year return levels, while the model slightly overestimates the mean number of dry spells, at the grid-cell scale. Analysis of projected changes to dry spell characteristics for the future 2041--2070 and 2071--2100 periods, with respect to 1971--2000 period, suggests significant changes, particularly for the southern Prairies, where both mean number of dry days and return levels of maximum dry spell durations are projected to increase. Furthermore, combined analysis of changes to the amount of precipitation and mean number of dry days also suggests potential increase in drought conditions in future climates in this already drought-prone region for the April--September period. In addition to southern Prairies, this study also suggests significant changes to dry spell characteristics for other regions of Canada.",

	abstract = "Recent and potential future increases in global temperatures are likely to be associated with impacts on the hydrologic cycle, including changes to precipitation and increases in extreme events such as droughts. We analyze changes in drought occurrence using soil moisture data for the SRES B1, A1B and A2 future climate scenarios relative to the PICNTRL pre-industrial control and 20C3M twentieth century simulations from eight AOGCMs that participated in the IPCC AR4. Comparison with observation forced land surface model estimates indicates that the models do reasonably well at replicating our best estimates of twentieth century, large scale drought occurrence, although the frequency of long-term (more than 12-month duration) droughts are over-estimated. Under the future projections, the models show decreases in soil moisture globally for all scenarios with a corresponding doubling of the spatial extent of severe soil moisture deficits and frequency of short-term (4--6-month duration) droughts from the mid-twentieth century to the end of the twenty-first. Long-term droughts become three times more common. Regionally, the Mediterranean, west African, central Asian and central American regions show large increases most notably for long-term frequencies as do mid-latitude North American regions but with larger variation between scenarios. In general, changes under the higher emission scenarios, A1B and A2 are the greatest, and despite following a reduced emissions pathway relative to the present day, the B1 scenario shows smaller but still substantial increases in drought, globally and for most regions. Increases in drought are driven primarily by reductions in precipitation with increased evaporation from higher temperatures modulating the changes. In some regions, increases in precipitation are offset by increased evaporation. Although the predicted future changes in drought occurrence are essentially monotonic increasing globally and in many regions, they are generally not statistically different from contemporary climate (as estimated from the 1961--1990 period of the 20C3M simulations) or natural variability (as estimated from the PICNTRL simulations) for multiple decades, in contrast to primary climate variables, such as global mean surface air temperature and precipitation. On the other hand, changes in annual and seasonal means of terrestrial hydrologic variables, such as evaporation and soil moisture, are essentially undetectable within the twenty-first century. Changes in the extremes of climate and their hydrological impacts may therefore be more detectable than changes in their means.",

The longest wet spells, computed for two different thresholds (0.1 mm and 1 mm), were observed in Western Greece and Crete, whereas the shortest ones were found in the central and south Aegean. A detailed analysis of the wet spells, dividing them into three classes, shows that on an annual basis their highest frequencies were observed in Western and Northwestern Greece. The seasonal results are also quite similar. The trends and the variability of the mean length of the wet spells were also analyzed. Negative trends were found in the case of the year-to-year analysis and during winter. Finally, this study presents an evaluation of two theoretical distribution models; the second order Markov Chains (MC2) and the Negative Binomial Distribution (NBD), by their adjustment to the empirical data. Both models can be used in the future for an estimation of the wet spells in the area under study.",

	abstract = "Three objective techniques used to obtain gauge-based daily precipitation analyses over global land areas are assessed. The objective techniques include the inverse-distance weighting algorithms of Cressman (1959) and Shepard (1968), and the optimal interpolation (OI) method of Gandin (1965). Intercomparisons and cross-validation tests are conducted to examine their performance over various parts of the globe where station network densities are different. The gauge data used in the examinations are quality controlled daily precipitation reports from roughly 16,000 stations over the global land areas that have been collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center (CPC). Data sources include daily summary files from the Global Telecommunication System (GTS), and the CPC unified daily gauge data sets over the contiguous United States (CONUS), Mexico, and South America. All three objective techniques are capable of generating useful daily precipitation analyses with biases of generally less than 1\% over most parts of the global land areas. The OI method consistently performs the best among the three techniques for almost all situations (regions, seasons, and network densities). The Shepard scheme compares reasonably well with the OI, while the Cressman method tends to generate smooth precipitation fields with wider raining areas relative to the station observations. The quality of the gauge-based analyses degrades as the network of station observations becomes sparser, although the OI technique exhibits relatively stable performance statistics over regions covered by fewer gauges.",

	abstract = "The study of the temporal-spatial variability of dry sequences and the probability of their occurrence are particularly important in understanding the impact of climate change on droughts.This paper analyses the different properties of dry sequences, focussing on extreme condition, analysing their degree of spatial coherence, and their temporal variability. For the study, daily precipitation data are used for the period 1961--2000 throughout Argentina.The region north of 40°S is divided in two from the meridian of 63°W with highly differentiated {\lq}dry{\rq} properties. The eastern region is more homogeneous where mean dry sequences last less than six days and long sequences of about 60 days. The Andean region shows a marked east--west gradient in any of the above properties, with extreme values of over 10 days (mean sequences) and 150 days (the longest sequences). At the seasonal level the above properties reflect a differential pattern according to the time of year under study. In the case of summer, when the dry sequences can be more harmful to crops, the maximum duration in the Pampa region can extend to about 25 days.Owing to the problems that dry sequences of over 30 days can produce in the different ecosystems and based on the above findings, the temporal-spatial variability is analysed, and a variability over the years, together with a progressive decrease in the occurrence of such events, is found.The study of extreme dry events provides useful tools that can be applied to different hydrological and agricultural needs. Furthermore, our climatological findings help validate climate models. Copyright © 2010 Royal Meteorological Society",

The ERA-Interim project was conducted in part to prepare for a new atmospheric reanalysis to replace ERA-40, which will extend back to the early part of the twentieth century. This article describes the forecast model, data assimilation method, and input datasets used to produce ERA-Interim, and discusses the performance of the system. Special emphasis is placed on various difficulties encountered in the production of ERA-40, including the representation of the hydrological cycle, the quality of the stratospheric circulation, and the consistency in time of the reanalysed fields. We provide evidence for substantial improvements in each of these aspects. We also identify areas where further work is needed and describe opportunities and objectives for future reanalysis projects at ECMWF. Copyright © 2011 Royal Meteorological Society",

Previous studies focused over climatically homogeneous mid-high latitude areas, employing fixed temperature thresholds (related to climatic features such as freezing point) that can be inadequate when different climate conditions are present. We propose a method related to the daily minimum and maximum temperature 25th and 75th point-dependent climatic percentiles. It is applied to an ensemble of regional climate models (RCMs) of 25-km horizontal resolution over the peninsular Spain and Balearic Islands, where a large variety of climatic regimes, from alpine to semi-desertic conditions, are present. First, baseline climate (1961--2000) ERA40-forced RCM simulations are successfully compared with the Spain02 daily observational database, following astronomical season length (around 90 days). This result confirms the validity of the proposed method and capability of the RCMs to describe the seasonal features. Future climate global climate model-forced RCMs (2071--2100) compared with present climate (1961--1990) simulations indicate the disappearance of winter season, a summer enlargement (onset and end) and a slight spring and autumn increase.",
